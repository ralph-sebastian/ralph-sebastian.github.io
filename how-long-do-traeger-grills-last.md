While the lifespan of a Traeger grill depends on various factors, proper maintenance can help you make the most of your investment and enjoy years of grilling pleasure:

Clean your grill after each use to prevent grease buildup, rust, and corrosion. Empty the grease bucket and clean the drip tray to ensure efficient performance.

Regularly inspect your grill for any signs of wear, rust, or loose parts. Addressing minor issues promptly can prevent them from escalating.

Moisture can accelerate rust and corrosion. Whenever possible, keep your grill protected from rain and humidity.

Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning, maintenance, and usage guidelines specific to your Traeger grill model.

The lifespan of a Traeger grill can vary widely based on the factors mentioned earlier. Generally, with proper care and maintenance, you can expect a Traeger grill to last anywhere from 5 to 20 years or even longer. Higher-end models and those constructed with superior materials tend to have longer lifespans.

It's important to recognize when it might be time to consider replacing your Traeger grill:

- **Excessive Rust:** If your grill has significant rust that affects its structural integrity or performance, it may be time to invest in a new one.
